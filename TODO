  - each level should start where the previous one ended
  - first levels where you need to reverse time on reaching
    the target should have a modal for it
  - disable time travel on the levels that don't require it
    (can just be via uncommenting code to prevent time travel
     before you reach the target)
  - modal explaining why you can't go back in time somewhere
    you already started
